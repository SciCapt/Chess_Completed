Holy cow it's working
It's a game of chess what else should I say

Introductory Banter:
I think this only works for Windows OS. I wouldn't know as I don't know the Command Prompt commands in any other OS. This would frankly be an easy fix, I just don't have any machines to test it on.

It is worth noting that when running the game via the bat file (it just simply launchs 'Game Controller.py', you will first be prompted if you want AI to play against. If you don't want to play with Bob (see below), then just press enter and get on with your life. I'm sure Bob will understand.

(Currently, the only AI (Bob) chooses random moves out of the avaliable moves it has. When I'm clever enough, I'll code in a few more chess AI's as frankly that was the entire purpose of this project. Now that the game works and doesn't seem to have any major so AI's will be my next task).


CONTROLS AND STUFF:
Don't move the CMD when it starts up and resizes!!!! To enable the following controls, It must be at a particular part of the screen, with its particular size.

- Right-click is your friend. Either select a piece with right click or click again somewhere to unselect (possible moves will be highlighted for you). If you select a piece that has no moves, it will be automatically deselected and the game will be ready for you to select a different piece.

That's about it, no fancy controls here


Other Misc:
When a checkmate scenario is detected the screen will no longer print frames of the chess game and instead will give a message saying checkmate was detected and which player won.

It should be obvious which pieces are the white ones and which are the black ones. I did the best I could with the graphics!
